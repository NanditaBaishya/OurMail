# OurMail
This is a PHP implementation of an Email System.

If the user want to run the application, they can do so in xampp server preferrably, or any other server. 

The user need to create a database with name "ourmail" and import the datafiles provided in the "ourmail" database. 
Copy the entire folder to a directly named "htdocs" in the "xampp" directory. 
Start Apache and MySQL on Xampp control panel.
open your favorite browser and acess the application through "http://<hostname>/<foldername>/"
  
Happy Coding!
